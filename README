I wanted to learn OCaml, I wanted to write an IRC bot, so I killed two birds with one stone.

Files
-----
bumbot.ml provides the basic stuff you'll need to write a bot on top of bumbot.

loggingbot.ml is a sample bot built on top of bumbot.  It's pretty rough around the edges right now.

Usage
-----
To build a bot on top of bumbot you simply call connect_bot, providing host, port, nickname, room, and a function for handling received commands. The handler function takes a Bumbot.irc_message and returns a Bumbot.irc_response.

Compiling
---------
To compile loggingbot simply run
    ocamlbuild -l unix -l str loggingbot.native

To run do
    ./loggingbot.native host port nick room logbase

The # is automatically prefixed

TODOs
-----
- Rework bumbot message parsing
- Make loggingbot a little less rough around the edges
